# roots-cli

Start a brand new Roots project with one command.

**Warning: This project is pre-alpha**

The base implementation will serve the following requirements:

- Generate a Sage theme starting point
- Generate a Bedrock scaffold
- Generate a Trellis install
- Generate a project with all of the above

After this base implementation is accomplished, we can examine more features that will benefit other parts of a project lifecycle. See [Issue #1](https://github.com/roots/roots-cli/issues/1)

## Current phase: scaffold a basic Trellis project

See [Issue #2](https://github.com/roots/roots-cli/issues/2)

## Installation

```
go get github.com/roots/roots-cli
